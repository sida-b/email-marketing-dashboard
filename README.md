# âœ‰ Email Marketing Dashboard
## Introduction
I analyzed a fictitious email marketing dataset from Enterprise DNA. The dataset was an excel file with 2 sheets. One sheet included customer data, products each customer bought, and sales. The other sheet had data of emails sent to each customer and whether the customer received it, opened it, and clicked on the link in the email. The goal of this analysis was to discover the relationship between emails and sales. **I used Power BI for this analysis.**
